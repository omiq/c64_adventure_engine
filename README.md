# c64_adventure_engine
My XC=Basic C64 Text Adventure engine for [Maker Hacks tutorial](https://makerhacks.com)

* c64-text-adventure.prg is the currently compiled game
* c64-text-adventure.bas is the XC=Basic code as it currently stands

Also
* bits.bas is a library to help work with bits of bytes :)
* load pic is a demo of compiling external binary data into the prg (in this case a bitmap)
